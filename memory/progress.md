# AI Gladiators: Onchain Arena - Progress Log

## Step 0 - Project Setup (Completed)

### Done:
- Initialized a Phaser 3 project with TypeScript using Vite
- Set up the basic folder structure:
  - `/scenes` - For game scenes (BootScene created)
  - `/objects` - For game entities (empty)
  - `/types` - For TypeScript interfaces (IGladiatorStats created)
  - `/utils` - For shared logic (constants.ts created)
  - `/assets` - For game sprites and audio (empty)
- Created a simple BootScene with colored background
- Implemented basic constants and configuration files
- Set up the HTML structure and CSS styling for the game container

### Test Results:
- ✅ Successfully runs an empty Phaser scene with a colored background
- ✅ The game title is displayed in the center of the screen
- ✅ Console logs confirm that the BootScene has been created successfully

### Notes for Future Developers:
- The project uses Vite for faster development and building
- Phaser 3 is set up with the Arcade physics system
- A basic constants.ts file contains game dimensions and color schemes
- The IGladiatorStats interface is prepared for use with the Gladiator class in Step 2
- Debug mode and development mode flags are available in GameConfig.ts

### Next Steps:
- Step 1.1 - Create ArenaScene.ts
- Step 1.2 - Add spawn zones for AI gladiators

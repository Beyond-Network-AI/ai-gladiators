# AI Gladiators: Onchain Arena - Progress Log

## Step 0 - Project Setup (Completed)

### Done:
- Initialized a Phaser 3 project with TypeScript using Vite
- Set up the basic folder structure:
  - `/scenes` - For game scenes (BootScene created)
  - `/objects` - For game entities (empty)
  - `/types` - For TypeScript interfaces (IGladiatorStats created)
  - `/utils` - For shared logic (constants.ts created)
  - `/assets` - For game sprites and audio (empty)
- Created a simple BootScene with colored background
- Implemented basic constants and configuration files
- Set up the HTML structure and CSS styling for the game container

### Test Results:
- ✅ Successfully runs an empty Phaser scene with a colored background
- ✅ The game title is displayed in the center of the screen
- ✅ Console logs confirm that the BootScene has been created successfully

### Notes for Future Developers:
- The project uses Vite for faster development and building
- Phaser 3 is set up with the Arcade physics system
- A basic constants.ts file contains game dimensions and color schemes
- The IGladiatorStats interface is prepared for use with the Gladiator class in Step 2
- Debug mode and development mode flags are available in GameConfig.ts

## Step 1 - Arena Scene Setup (Completed)

### Done:
- Created ArenaScene.ts with basic structure
- Added spawn zones for AI gladiators in the four corners of the arena
- Implemented visualization of spawn zones for debugging
- Updated BootScene to transition to ArenaScene after 2 seconds
- Added ArenaScene to the game scenes list in main.ts

### Test Results:
- ✅ BootScene successfully transitions to ArenaScene after a short delay
- ✅ Arena scene displays with the correct background color
- ✅ Four spawn zones are visible in the corners of the arena
- ✅ Each spawn zone is properly labeled (Zone 1, Zone 2, etc.)

## Step 2 - AI Gladiators (Completed)

### Done:
- Created Gladiator.ts class with position, sprite, and randomly generated stats
- Implemented Finite State Machine (FSM) with 5 states: idle, seek, attack, evade, collectPowerUp
- Added state transitions based on gladiator stats, health, and proximity to other gladiators
- Implemented health and knockout logic with visual effects
- Added gladiator spawning to ArenaScene, with one gladiator in each spawn zone
- Set up collision handling between gladiators
- Implemented targeting system where gladiators seek the nearest opponent
- Added match timer and end-of-match detection

### Test Results:
- ✅ Gladiators spawn at correct positions with randomly generated stats
- ✅ Gladiators actively seek opponents, attack, and transition between states
- ✅ Health bars display and update correctly when damage is taken
- ✅ Gladiators are knocked out when health reaches zero
- ✅ Match ends when only one gladiator remains or time runs out
- ✅ Match automatically restarts after completion

### Next Steps:
- Step 3.1 - Create PowerUp class
- Step 3.2 - Add Arena Hazards

## Step 3 - Power-Ups & Hazards (Completed)

### Done:
- Created PowerUpType.ts with enum for different power-up types (shield, trap, chaos)
- Created PowerUp.ts class with visual effects, behaviors, and type-specific effects
- Created HazardType.ts with enum for hazard types (spike wall, fireball)
- Created ArenaHazard.ts class with movements, effects, and collision behaviors
- Updated ArenaScene to spawn power-ups randomly throughout the match
- Added hazard spawning system with timed spawning of spike walls and fireballs
- Implemented collision handling between gladiators and power-ups/hazards
- Added visual effects for power-ups and hazards with particles
- Modified gladiator targeting to prioritize nearby power-ups

### Updates:
- Removed speed power-up type to focus on more impactful power-ups (shield, trap, chaos)
- Fixed defense stat implementation to properly reduce damage with shields

### Test Results:
- ✅ Power-ups appear during the match and are picked up by Gladiators
- ✅ Power-ups apply different effects based on their type (shield, trap, chaos)
- ✅ Hazards function correctly with spike walls moving across the arena and fireballs falling
- ✅ Gladiators can be damaged by environmental hazards
- ✅ Gladiators intelligently seek power-ups when nearby
- ✅ Shield power-up properly reduces damage taken by gladiators

### Next Steps:
- Step 4.1 - Create UIScene with match timer, gladiator stats, and prediction panel
- Step 4.2 - Add "Connect Wallet" functionality with zoraClient

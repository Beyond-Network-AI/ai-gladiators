# AI Gladiators Assets

This directory contains the asset files for the AI Gladiators game.

## Directory Structure

- `gladiators/` - Character sprites for the gladiators
- `powerups/` - Visual assets for power-ups (shield, trap, chaos)
- `hazards/` - Visual assets for arena hazards (spike walls, fireballs)
- `arena/` - Background and tileset assets for the game arena
- `ui/` - User interface elements

## Asset Credits

For this project, we use free, open-licensed assets.

## Visual Style Guide

- Pixel art style for better readability and performance
- Clean, high-contrast colors for game elements
- Assets sized appropriate for the game scale (800x840px canvas)
- Each gladiator has a distinct color palette for easy identification
- Power-ups use intuitive colors: green (shield), red (trap), orange/yellow (chaos)
- Hazards use warning colors (red, orange) to communicate danger

## Custom Particle Effects

The game uses procedurally generated particles for various effects:
- Attack impacts
- Power-up collection
- Hazard damage
- Gladiator defeat

## Styling Notes

1. All game sprites use pixelated rendering for a retro arcade feel
2. UI elements use the "Press Start 2P" font for an arcade aesthetic
3. The game container has a custom border to frame the arena
4. Custom CSS animations enhance the visual appeal
